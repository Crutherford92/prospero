		<h1>About us</h1>
		<p class="aboutP">
			Prospero was founded by our Supreme Leader Mr Martin Rutherford and thanks to his hard work, autistic level math comprehension and questionable ethics Prospero has risen to become the worlds most effective forensic accountancy firm. Over the years Prospero have had the honer of working with high profile clients such as Vladimir Putin (as pictured below), Rayful Edmond and Rolf Harris to name a few. Our clients trust us, as we here at prospero do not ask questions we give answers.

		<p class="aboutP">
			Our expertise and services are in 6 core areas – tracing, digital fraud, corporate investigations, loss prevention for business, spec-ops and annihilation. Working with us, you know for certain that you’re working with professionals who can give you strategic and useful insights as well as swift and savage reprisals. Here at Prospero we live and die by our motto “By any means”.
		
		<p class="aboutP">
			The numbers in a set of account can hide a range of fraudulent activity from the casual or even the experienced eye. It is Prospero's job to look beyond the numbers into the business practices that could be hiding behind them and how these may reveal vermin at work. Once exposed Mr Martin begins a quick and efficient extermination process. Less than 2% of our cases ever need legal intervention thanks to Mr Martins notoriously secretive methods.
